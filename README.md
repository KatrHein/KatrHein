- 👋 Hi, I’m @KatrHein
- 👀 I’m interested in almost anything. I love plots and critical analysis of numbers and other stuff. So far I'm better at R than Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. Am planning to get better at R-Shiny with a view to dashboards and at Machine Learning in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun ;-)
- 📫 How to not reach me: I am not actively using "social media" so far. Emails are fine.
